# Superstore Data Analysis Project



**Please follow these instructions to set up the dataset for analysis:**

1. Navigate to the "data_warehouse" directory within the project repository. The Superstore.zip file is already available in this directory.

2. Before running the Superstore.sql file, ensure that you have created a database with the desired name in your database management system.

3. Open the Superstore.sql file and locate the line containing `USE YOUR_DB_NAME;`.

4. Replace `YOUR_DB_NAME` with the name of the database you created in step 2.

5. Run the Superstore.sql file in your database management system. This will create all the necessary tables and rows used for the final data analysis.

Now you are ready to proceed with the data analysis project on the Superstore sales dataset, following the sections outlined below:

## Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive data analysis of a superstore's sales dataset, aiming to gain valuable insights and provide actionable recommendations to improve business performance. The analysis is divided into four main sections:

### Data Warehouse Preparation

In this phase, the raw data is preprocessed and cleaned to ensure its quality and reliability. The data warehouse structure is designed, incorporating Fact and Dimension tables to establish a robust and efficient database architecture. Proper keys and relationships between the tables are established to facilitate seamless data integration. The finalized data is then imported into Power BI, ensuring that the correct relationships are maintained within the visualization tool.

### Statistical Analysis

The impact of discounts on sales is a critical aspect of the superstore's performance that requires thorough investigation. The data is divided into discount and non-discount groups, and an in-depth analysis of the distribution of sold items in each group is conducted. Statistical tests are employed to determine if there is a significant difference between the two groups, shedding light on the effectiveness of discounts in driving sales.

### Machine Learning

#### Task 1: Profit Estimation

To further enhance the understanding of the business, a machine learning model is built to predict the profit of each sold product. Relevant features are carefully selected, and the data is preprocessed to ensure optimal model performance. The model is trained with a focus on generalizability, avoiding overfitting, and producing accurate profit estimates.

#### Task 2: Shipping Mode Prediction

The efficiency of the superstore's shipping processes can significantly impact customer satisfaction and overall profitability. To address this, a machine learning model is developed to predict the appropriate shipping mode for each order. The data is preprocessed, and suitable features are chosen to train the model effectively. The model's performance is thoroughly evaluated to ensure its reliability in optimizing shipping operations.

### Dashboard Creation

The insights obtained from the data analysis and machine learning tasks are presented in an interactive and informative Power BI dashboard. The preprocessed data is imported into Power BI, and the dashboard is thoughtfully designed to provide meaningful visualizations that facilitate a clear understanding of the findings. The dashboard will serve as a powerful tool for decision-makers to access crucial information at a glance and make informed business decisions.
